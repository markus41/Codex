# Terraform and OpenTofu Skill

## Workflow
1. Confirm runtime target: Terraform, OpenTofu, or mixed migration.
2. Use official references first; use ecosystem references for comparisons and tutorials.
3. Return version-aware snippets and note provider/registry assumptions.

## References
- `references/terraform.md`
