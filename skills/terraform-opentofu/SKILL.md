# Terraform and OpenTofu Skill

## Workflow
1. Confirm runtime target: Terraform, OpenTofu, or mixed migration.
2. Select only the needed reference domains:
   - Core IaC language/CLI: Terraform + OpenTofu
   - Secret and identity foundations: Vault + Keycloak
   - Runtime packaging/orchestration: Docker + Helm/Kubernetes
3. Produce version-aware snippets, including provider/module assumptions and state backend notes.
4. For delivery requests, propose a plan/apply workflow with validation, policy checks, and rollback strategy.
