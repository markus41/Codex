# Flutter and Dart Skill

## Workflow
1. Determine whether the task is UI, architecture, testing, tooling, or package/plugin related.
2. Load Flutter references first; load Dart references for language/style/API questions.
3. Prefer concise, runnable examples with current Flutter patterns.

## References
- `references/flutter.md`
- `references/dart.md`
